~~~GIVEN~~~

an array of magnitudes
an array of phases
the length of the array of magnitudes and phases (they will be the same)

~~~ALGORITHM~~~

-start with a null signal
-for each magnitude and phase
	-summate the root signal
		-with the magnitude times the sin of the frequency plus the phase angle
